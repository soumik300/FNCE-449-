FNCE-449 Term Project
Welcome to the code repository for my FNCE 449 term project, where I analyze the effects of holding international equities in a portfolio and examine whether this approach enhances portfolio performance.

Project Overview
This project investigates the performance of two different portfolio strategies from 2018 to 2024:

Local Portfolio (Portfolio A): A portfolio containing only local equities.
Diversified International Portfolio (Portfolio B): A portfolio with international equity exposure.
The project culminates in finding an Optimal Portfolio (Portfolio C) through a Monte Carlo Simulation, aiming to maximize risk-adjusted returns by balancing asset allocations among international ETFs.

Files and Structure
1. ETF Returns.ipynb
Description: This notebook analyzes the historical returns of the following ETFs from 2018 to 2024:
SPY - U.S. Equities
EWC - Canadian Equities
VGK - European Equities
MCHI - Chinese Equities
EWJ - Japanese Equities
EWY - South Korean Equities
INDA - Indian Equities
Output: The notebook produces a graph titled ETF Cumulative Returns, comparing cumulative returns of these ETFs over the selected time period.
2. Term Project - FNCE 449.ipynb
Description: The main code file for the project. It includes the following analyses:
Portfolio A vs. Portfolio B: A comparative analysis and visualization of returns between the local and diversified portfolios over the same period.
Monte Carlo Simulation: A simulation to determine the optimal asset allocation, resulting in Portfolio C, which aims to achieve the best risk-adjusted return.
Output: The final visualization, Portfolio A vs. B vs. C, illustrates the cumulative returns of all three portfolios, demonstrating the potential impact of international diversification.
Key Results
Comparative Returns: This project highlights the performance variations between a purely local portfolio and one with international exposure, allowing for insights into the benefits (or drawbacks) of geographic diversification.
Optimal Portfolio Analysis: Using the Monte Carlo approach, I identify an optimal ETF allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns, offering a compelling comparison with the static allocations of Portfolios A and B
