# FNCE-449-
Welcome to my code for FNCE 449 - Term Project. This project will examine the effects of holding international equities in a portfolio to see if it increases portfolio performance.
The Python file ETF Returns looks at the returns of the following ETFs from 2018 to 2024: SPY, EWC, VGK, MCHI, EWJ, EWY, and INDA. The corresponding graph titled ETF Cumulative Returns compares the returns of the ETFs over this timespan
The Python file Term Project - FNCE 449 contains the code for the project. I look at two different portfolios, one consisting of local equities, and one with a diversified international portfolio, and then plot their returns on a graph titled Portfolio A v Portfolio B. This shows us how the two portfolios compare over this period. I then run a Monte Carlo Simulation to find the optimal portfolio that returns the best risk-adjusted return over this timespan. This optimal portfolio, Portfolio C is then compared against the former two portfolios to see how the optimal weightage of ETFs affects portfolio returns, as graphed in Portfolio A v B v C.
